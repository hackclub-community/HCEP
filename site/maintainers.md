# HCEP Falicitators/Maintainers

## About

HCEP Falicitators are the people who maintain the HCEP repo and manage [the `#hceps` Slack channel](https://hackclub.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C09ULRQ02KT)). All of the HCEP Falicitators are Hack Clubbers, either current or alumni (this include staff in the list).

## Responsibilities

* Create and manage tracking issues (and possibly their coressponding Slack thread in either `#meta`/`#hceps` channel) for each HCEP submitted.
* Review HCEP submissions and merge them into the main branch for archival and tracking proposes.
* Manage the `#hceps` Slack channel, including welcoming new members, answering questions, and enforcing the Hack Club Code of Conduct outside the Slack.

## How to add yourself here

1. Open a PR to add yourself to this list, alongside your contact details. We recommend linking to your Hack Club Slack profile, GitHub or GitLab.com handle and email address as a minimum.
2. Another maintainer will review your PR to check for activity within the Hack Club community as well as for Code of Conduct compliance.
3. Once your PR is approved and merged, you will be invited into the repository as a collaborator with maintainer permission level and granted channel management permissions at the Slack channel.

### Retiring from being a Falicitator/Maintainer

If you wish to retire from your maintainer role, please send a PR removing yourself from this list. Once merged, your maintainer permissions will be removed shortly afterwards, alongside the Channel Manager role.

We also consider you to be automatically retired if you have been inactive in the community for over six months or in case of a permanent community ban due to a major Code of Conduct violation. For inactivity, we may reach out over both Slack DMs and emails to confirm your status before proceeding with removal.
